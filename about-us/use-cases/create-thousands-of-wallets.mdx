title: "Create thousands of wallets"
---

With KeeperAgent, you can automatically create thousands, even tens of thousands of wallets in a very short time. KeeperAgent supports creating wallets for all EVM blockchains, Solana, Aptos, and Sui.

KeeperAgent uses the same algorithms as popular extensions like Metamask, Rabby, Phantom, and Martian. All wallet data is encrypted and stored locally on your computer. KeeperAgent servers do not store any of your wallet information.

You can export them to an Excel file and back them up on Google Drive or elsewhere. The exported Excel file is also encrypted. You will need to enter your `Secret key` to decrypt it. Only you have access to your `Secret key`, which allows you to decrypt the Excel file and view your wallet information. This means that you can safely store this Excel file in the cloud. Even if someone steals this Excel file, they will not be able to access your seed phrase or private key, thus cannot steal your assets.
