No need for complicated trading bots, you can easily build your own trading bots with simple drag-and-drop actions. All your seed phrases and private keys are stored securely on your own computer, fully under your control, and never shared with any third party.

KeeperAgent supports aggregator like Jupiter, Kyberswap, or direct swap features from pools on Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Raydium, and Cetus. You can easily customize settings such as slippage, maximum price impact, gas price, and priority fee in advance.

- Build a sell limit order bot monitoring [KEKIUS](https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0xfff8d5fff6ee3226fa2f5d7d5d8c3ff785be9c74) price on Ethereum. Executes Uniswap swap to sell `KEKIUS` for `ETH` if the price of `KEKIUS` exceeds \$0.01648
- Develop a sell limit order bot for `KEKIUS`. Executes swap if the market cap of `KEKIUS` exceeds \$100 million
- Create a buy limit order bot for `KEKIUS`. Executes purchase if the price of `KEKIUS` drops below \$0.01
