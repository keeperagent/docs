As mentioned earlier, a `Profile` is a combination of a `Wallet` and `Resource`, and serves as the input for running workflows. A `Campaign` is the combination of `Profile`, `Workflow`, and `Proxy`.

<Tip>
  Each workflow is executed within its own campaign, where the campaign specifies which profiles should be used for the workflow

Each workflow is executed within its own campaign, where the campaign specifies which profiles should be used for the workflow

A campaign will include the following configurations:

- `Profile`: Each campaign will only run with profiles _from the same group_
- `Workflow`: Each campaign can include one or multiple workflows, and these workflows will share the profiles configured within the campaign.
- `Proxy`: If your workflow interacts with the Chrome browser and requires a proxy, you can configure it here. You may choose your own list of proxies (IP, port) or use available rotating proxy services such as WWproxy.
- ... and other configurations

### Why do workflows need to be run through campaigns instead of directly from the workflow management feature?

We created the campaign feature to make running workflows more flexible. Instead of being limited to running a single workflow with only one Profile group, you can use the same workflows to create multiple campaigns and pair it with different Profile groups.

<Tip>
  Campaigns enable you to pair Workflows with Profile groups in flexible combinations: one Workflow with multiple Profile groups, or one Profile group with multiple Workflows.
