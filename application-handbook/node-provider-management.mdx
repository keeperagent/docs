For workflows that need to interact with the blockchain such as launch token, swap token, checking wallet balances, retrieving gas prices, sending tokens, or swapping tokens, you must have at least one node provider.

The node provider management feature makes it easy to organize providers into groups for different blockchains. When using workflows, simply select the provider group for the desired chain, and the system will automatically distribute requests in a round-robin fashion among the node providers in that group.

You can obtain node endpoints from any provider and import them into KeeperAgent. Some providers offer free node endpoints, such as:

- [Blockpi](https://blockpi.io/)
- [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/)
- [Infura](https://www.infura.io/)
- [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/)
