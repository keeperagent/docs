These proxies will be used on nodes that interact with the browser. For example, if an airdrop is restricted by IP address, you can assign a different proxy to each browser profile.

## Static proxy (fixed proxy)

If you want to launch the browser with a set of available static proxies (IP, port), use the static proxy management feature. When opening the browser, each instance will sequentially use a proxy from this set.

## Rotating proxy

If you want to use available proxy services like [WWWProxy](https://www.wwproxy.com/home?lang=en), simply enter the API key from these third-party services into KeeperAgent. When you launch the browser, we will automatically retrieve proxies based on your campaign and workflow settings (for example, one proxy may be used for a single browser profile, or shared among up to five profiles). The system will also automatically switch to a new proxy when the current one expires.
