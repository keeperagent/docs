This feature allows you to schedule Workflow execution. Note: Only workflows that are part of a campaign can be scheduled.

You can configure workflows to run in various modes, for example:

- Schedule a workflow to run daily, starting at 7 AM
- Schedule a workflow to run only once, starting at 7 AM on January 1, 2026
- Schedule a workflow to run only on even-numbered days, starting at 7 AM
- Schedule three different workflows to run in sequence, starting at 7 AM. Each workflow will begin only after the previous one has finished, following this order: Workflow `1` → Workflow `2` → Workflow `3`.

Workflows within the same schedule will run sequentially, while workflows in different schedules can run in parallel. For example, **Schedule 1** includes `Workflow 1` → `Workflow 2` → `Workflow 3`, and **Schedule 2** includes `Workflow 4` → `Workflow 5` → `Workflow 6`. `Workflows 4, 5, 6` can run in parallel with `Workflows 1, 2, 3`. This means you can execute many different workflows simultaneously using the scheduling feature.
