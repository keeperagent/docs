A wallet is an essential tool whenever you need to interact with the blockchain. As specialized blockchain software, we have created a dedicated section to help you manage your wallet easily and securely. Each wallet contains sensitive information such as the seed phrase, private key, and wallet address.

Our app offers two options: encrypted and unencrypted. If you choose `encrypted` the app will ask you to enter a secret key (think of it as a password you commonly use). Your seed phrase, private key, and wallet address will then be encrypted before being stored in the local database. Please note: you must remember your secret key to decrypt and view your wallet information.

- Manage existing wallets, this feature supports all types of blockchains.
- Quickly and automatically create thousands of new wallets. The wallet generation algorithm we use is the same as those used by popular extensions like Metamask, Rabby, Phantom, and Martian. This feature supports the following blockchains: all EVM blockchains (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, ZkSync, etc.), as well as Solana, Aptos, and Sui.
- You can verify the accuracy of wallets generated by our app by importing one into any of the mentioned wallet extensions. The wallet information displayed in the extension will match exactly with the information in our app.
