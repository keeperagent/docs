title: "Processor On/Off profile"
description: "Mark profiles as active or inactive"
---

Each Profile has two states: Active or Inactive. Only **Active** profiles are selected to run workflows, **Inactive** profiles are skipped."

Example: With 1000 wallets, you want to run a workflow that requires wallets with USDT balance above \$500. Only 10 wallets qualify. To optimize performance, pre-process Profile data: build a separate workflow to check balances, then use the `On/Off profile` Processor to mark Profiles with USDT balance below \$500 as Inactive.
