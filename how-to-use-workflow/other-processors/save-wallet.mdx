title: "Processor Save wallet"
description: "Save wallet information"

This processor creates a new wallet inside the Wallet group.

For example, if you prefer not to use KeeperAgent's bulk wallet generator, build a workflow that spins up a fresh Metamask wallet, then capture the new address, seed phrase, and private key with this processor.
