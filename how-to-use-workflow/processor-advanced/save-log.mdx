While executing a workflow, use this processor to capture logs for later review.

<div align="center">
  <img
    src="/images/save-log-example.png"
    alt="Example capture logs while the Workflow execution"
  />
  <p style={{ fontSize: "0.875rem", marginTop: "-1rem", color: "#666" }}>
    Example capture logs while the Workflow execution
  </p>
</div>

You can view these logs on the Log page:

<div align="center">
  <img
    src="/images/save-log-example-3.png"
    alt="View the logs captured during Workflow execution"
  />
  <p style={{ fontSize: "0.875rem", marginTop: "-1rem", color: "#666" }}>

  </p>
</div>
