title: "Processor Scroll"
description: Scroll the page by coordinates or to an element
---

This processor lets you scroll vertically or horizontally by coordinates, or smoothly move the viewport to an element identified by a CSS or XPath selector.

## Scroll the viewport by explicit coordinates

The processor scrolls the page by a specified number of pixels.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/scroll-example.png" alt="Example scroll by coordinates" />
  <p style={{ fontSize: "0.875rem", marginTop: "-1rem", color: "#666" }}>
    Example scroll by coordinates
  </p>
</div>

In that example, each scroll step moves the page down by 200 pixels.

## Scroll to an element using its selector

Pick the target element by CSS or XPath selector, and the processor scrolls directly to its position.

<div align="center">
  <img
    src="/images/scroll-example-3.png"
    alt="Example scroll to the form's input field"
  />
  <p style={{ fontSize: "0.875rem", marginTop: "-1rem", color: "#666" }}>
    Example scroll to the form's input field
  </p>
</div>
