title: "Processor Select window"
description: Select a browser window or extension popup
---

Use this processor in scenarios such as when an extension popup appears over the primary webpage and you need browser processors to act on the extension, switch to the extension window first. Or after finishing your extension tasks, switch back to interact with the main site.

<div align="center">
  <img
    src="/images/select-window-example.png"
    alt="Select Window processor interface"
  />
  <p style={{ fontSize: "0.875rem", marginTop: "-1rem", color: "#666" }}>
    Select Window processor interface
  </p>
</div>

This processor provides two options:

- **Extension window**: choose this when you need to interact with the extension.
- **Main page**: use this when you want to switch back from the extension to the primary site.
