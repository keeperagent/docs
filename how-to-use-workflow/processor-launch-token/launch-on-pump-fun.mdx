This processor enables you to launch tokens on [pump.fun](http://pump.fun) in just a few seconds. Simply enter the token name, symbol, and image URL, and your token will be launched immediately. Our bot supports creators purchasing tokens within the same transaction hash as the token launch transaction. Additionally, when launching tokens through this processor, you can configure the token address to end with ...`pump`

This processor can be combined with other processors such as [Agent](https://docs.keeperagent.com/how-to-use-workflow/processor-agent) processor to build workflows. For example: use the OpenAI model to generate the token name and symbol, then create the token logo using OpenAI's image generation model, and finally use this data to launch the token.
