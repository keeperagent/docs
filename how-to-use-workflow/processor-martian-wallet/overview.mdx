These processors streamline how you work with the Martian wallet. For any tasks involving the Martian browser extension, they automatically **Select the extension window -\>** **Perform the required actions** -\> **Return to the main page**. That means once you use these processors, you no longer need the [Select window](/how-to-use-workflow/processor-browser/processor-select-window) processor.

You can use the Martian wallet on both the Aptos and Sui blockchains.

<Info>
  Note: the processor might not behave correctly if your Martian version's interface differs from the one we used during development.
