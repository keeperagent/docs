title: "Processor Select token"
---

This processor lets you pick a token on a given chain as long as its balance exceeds a specific threshold. It currently supports EVM-based chains only.

Use this processor when you want to bridge $100 from Arbitrum to Optimism but aren't sure whether your wallet holds enough USDT or USDC. It returns the token name and contract address of whichever asset satisfies the balance > 100 condition, storing them in `SELECTED_TOKEN_NAME` and `SELECTED_TOKEN_ADDRESS`.
