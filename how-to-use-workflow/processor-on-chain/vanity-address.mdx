title: "Processor Vanity address"
---

This processor generates addresses with a specific prefix or suffix, only support on Solana.

For example, to launch a token on Pump.fun with the suffix, you need to pre-generate these addresses and save them for later use. The longer the suffix or prefix, the more time the processor takes to run.
