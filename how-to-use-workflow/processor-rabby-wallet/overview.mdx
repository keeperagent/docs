These processors streamline how you work with the Rabby wallet. For any tasks involving the Rabby browser extension, they automatically **Select the extension window ->** **Perform the required actions** -> **Return to the main page**. That means once you use these processors, you no longer need the [Select window](/how-to-use-workflow/processor-browser/processor-select-window) processor.

For EVM chains, we recommend _using Rabby instead of Metamask_. Rabby runs more smoothly, keeps the workflow simpler, and reduces the number of steps, which helps workflow run with fewer errors.

  Note: the processor might not behave correctly if your Rabby version's
  interface differs from the one we used during development.
