All Processors share the same general settings section as follows:

<div align="center">
<img src="/images/general-settings-section-image-1.png" alt="Settings section for the Balance retrieval Processor" style={{ maxWidth: "600px" }} />

<p style={{ fontSize:"0.875rem",color:"#666" }}>
Settings section for the Balance retrieval Processor

</p>

</div>

This section contains key settings that define how a Processor runs:

- `Wait time (seconds)`: After this Processor finishes running, the workflow will wait for a specified period before proceeding to the next Processor. For example, if the wait time is set to 3 seconds, the workflow will pause for 3 seconds after the `Balance retrieval` Processor completes, before moving on to the `Uniswap swap` Processor. If the wait time is set to 0, the workflow will immediately proceed to the next Processor without waiting.
- `Timeout (seconds)`: The maximum time allowed for a Processor to complete its task. For example, if the timeout is set to 10 seconds and the `Balance retrieval` Processor does not finish within that time, the workflow will report an error. How this error is handled will be specified in the On error section.

## Processor result handling

When a Processor finishes running, there are two possible outcomes:

- On success: The Processor successfully completes its task.
- On error: The Processor reports an error during execution, which may be due to exceeding the maximum timeout or another issue.

<Info>
  When running, a workflow can execute multiple threads in parallel, with each thread operating on a separate Profile.

For the `On success` result:
