A workflow can contain multiple types of Processors, each performing different tasks. The Processors within a workflow run sequentially, once one Processor completes its job, the next Processor begins execution.

As shown in the example above, the token swap workflow consists of three Processors. When the workflow runs, it will execute each Processor sequentially from `Start` to `Stop`.

1. `Balance retrieval` Processor: Connects to the blockchain node to obtain the wallet's token balance.
2. `Uniswap Swap` Processor: Executes token swaps from Uniswap pools using the Uniswap Universal Router contract (just like swapping on the Uniswap interface). This processor swaps directly via the contract, without needing a web interface or wallet extensions like Metamask or Rabby.
3. `Bot message` Processor: Sends any message to a Telegram group chat. In this example, it will send the transaction hash resulting from the previous `Uniswap Swap` Processor.

Each Processor includes various settings and customizations, allowing you to build a wide range of workflows. Details will be described more thoroughly in the following sections.
