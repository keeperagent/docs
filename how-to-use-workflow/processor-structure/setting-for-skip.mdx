title: "Setting for Skip"
description: "all Processors are the same in this section"
---

This section determines whether a Process should run after the preceding Processor has finished. The default configuration is `Continue running`. You may alternatively select `Skip this Processor`, which causes the workflow to bypass that step and move forward to the subsequent Processor.

In the example above, the `Uniswap Swap` Processor will not run if the wallet balance stored in the variable `WALLET_BALANCE` is zero. When executing the workflow, it will skip the `Uniswap Swap` Processor and proceed to the next Processor, which is the `Telegram notification`. (`WALLET_BALANCE` is the variable that stores the result from the `Balance retrieval` Processor)
