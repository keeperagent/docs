For example, you can swap the FARTCOIN token for SOL.

The example above demonstrates how to configure a swap from the [FARTCOIN](https://solscan.io/token/9BB6NFEcjBCtnNLFko2FqVQBq8HHM13kCyYcdQbgpump) token to SOL on the Solana network.

## Configuration fields

| Field                        | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Variable to save result      | Yes      | This Processor will output the transaction hash of the swap. You can choose a variable name to store the transaction hash. For example: `TX_HASH_SWAP_TOKEN_JUPITER`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Private key                  | Yes      | This is the private key of the wallet performing the transaction. Each Profile has a default variable for storing the private key, so you can use the default variable `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Node endpoint group          | Yes      | Select the blockchain node provider                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Input token address          | Yes      | For example, if you want to swap FARTCOIN for SOL (i.e., sell FARTCOIN), you should enter the token address of FARTCOIN in this section                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Output token address         | Yes      | Enter the address of the token you want to receive after the swap. For example, if you want to swap FARTCOIN for SOL (i.e., sell FARTCOIN), you should enter the token address of SOL in this section                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Input token amount           | Yes      | Enter the amount of tokens you want to sell. For example, if you want to sell 1,000 FARTCOIN for SOL, you should enter `1000`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Slippage tolerance (%)       | Yes      | Maximum slippage for swaps. For pools with stable prices, you should set a low value for this field (such as 0.3% or 0.5%). For pools with highly volatile prices over short periods, use a higher value to ensure your swap goes through. If token prices are fluctuating significantly and you’re unsure what slippage to use, you can select `Use dynamic slippage (estimated by Jupiter)?` In this case, the slippage will be automatically calculated by Jupiter |
| Max price impact (%)         | Yes      | Maximum price impact for swaps. For pools with high liquidity, you should set this value low (e.g., 0.3%, 0.5%). For pools with low liquidity, you may choose a higher value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Max Priority fee (SOL)       | No       | Priority fee for executing the transaction. If you leave this field blank, the priority fee will default to the current average on the chain. For best results, you should specify a priority fee to increase the likelihood of a successful swap transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Total number of transactions | Yes      | The minimum value is 1. If you enter a value greater than 1, such as `10`, this processor will broadcast 10 swap transactions simultaneously to increase the likelihood that multiple transactions are included in the same block                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Wait for confirmation?       | No       | If you enable this option, the Processor will wait for the swap transaction to be confirmed before proceeding to the next Processor. If you leave it unchecked, the Processor will broadcast the swap transaction without waiting for confirmation and immediately move on to the next Processor                                                                                                                                                                      |
