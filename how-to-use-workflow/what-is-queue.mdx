The **Queue** sits between the processors and holds information about the Profiles that are currently running.

For example, suppose the `Get wallet balance` processor finishes and you want to wait another 3 seconds before running the `Check balance` processor. Once the profile completes the wallet balance processor, it moves into the queue and waits there for 3 seconds. When that time is up, the profile proceeds to the `Check balance` processor to continue.

## View queue details

To view the details of a queue, left-click the queue and choose `View queue`.

If you choose **Clear queue**, every profile currently waiting is removed from the active flow, and the flows pull in new profiles to keep running.

## View profile details

To see the details for any profile in the queue, hover your mouse over the `Profile` column.

As each processor runs, the variables attached to the Profile can change based on the logic of your workflow. To track those value changes or to debug, you can inspect the variables directly in the queue.

<Tip>
  Tip: To debug and see how variable values change during workflow execution, increase the **Waiting time** (e.g., 180 seconds).
